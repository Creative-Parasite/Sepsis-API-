# Sepsis-API-
Sepsis *also known as a blood poisioning*
Sepsis is a life threatening condition characterized by a sudden severe and inflammatory change in the blood usually involving circulatory system. It can lead to severe complications such as pneumonia, septic shock or death.
In this repo we will be building an API that detects a patient in the ICU for sepsis.

***Features***
*ID*: number to represent patient ID

*PRG*: Plasma glucose.

*PL*: Blood Work Result-1 (mu U/ml)

*PR*: Blood Pressure (mm Hg)

*SK*: Blood Work Result-2 (mm)

*TS*: Blood Work Result-3 (mu U/ml)

*M11*: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2

*BD2*: Blood Work Result-4 (mu U/ml)

*Age*: patients age (years)

*Insurance*: If a patient holds a valid insurance card

*Sepsis*: Positive: if a patient in ICU will develop a sepsis , and Negative: otherwis
